AnnaBot - Annotation Assertion Based Object Testing

Ian Darwin, http://www.darwinsys.com/

For a quick demo, run

java -classpath build:lib/javaee.jar:lib/darwinsys.jar annabot.AnnaBot claimclasses systestclasses

To set up for developing and testing AnnaBot as an Eclipse
project, assuming you checked it out under Eclipse as a project:
1) Create a new JUnit 4 Run Configuration:
	Name: AnnaBot Unit Tests
	Class: AnnaBotTests

Run this; it should run > 50 tests and give a green bar.

2) Create a Java Application Configuration
	Name: AnnaBot System Tests
	Class: annabot.AnnaBot
	Arguments -> Application Arguments: claimclasses systestclasses

Run this; it should give output something like the following:

Using 7 claims from directory claimclasses
Checking 4 targets from directory systestclasses
AnnaBot: Initialization took 0.1 seconds
class violations.JPAEntityNoArgConstructor: JPA Entities must have a no-arg constructor
class violations.JPAEntityMethodFieldAnnotated: JPA Entity must have an ID
class violations.JPAEntityMethodFieldAnnotated: JPA Entities may have field OR method annotations, not both
class violations.JPAEntityHasId: JPA Entity must have an ID
class violations.JPAEntitySetMethodAnnotated: JPA Entities may have field OR method annotations, not both
AnnaBot: found 5 error(s) in 4 classes, time 0.3 seconds

Now you can dive in and start working on the code!

Remember: CVS update periodically. Send cvs diff -u (or Eclipse patch) diffs.
