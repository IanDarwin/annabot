This folder contains a starting set of System Tests.
They have been run manually up to now, meaning
you need to set up an Eclipse Run Configuration
(it's unfortunate that Eclipse saves Run Configurations
in the Workspace instead of the Project so they
don't get committed with the project! Maybe there
was a good reason for this...).
There should be a script by the time the paper is presented.
